Change Log
==========
Version 1.2.0 *(2018-8-3)*
----------------------------
*  Changed: `lint.xml` is no longer autogenerated. Lint will now always use the `lint.xml` that included in the library. **Clients updating to this version should delete their `lint.xml` and use `lintOptions` gradle block instead to override the rules.** The reasoning behind this change is so that clients can have their custom lint rule overrides while still have the default set of rules synced with this library when they update.
